# Movie Application üé¨

A Flutter-based movie application that allows users to browse, search, and save their favorite movies. This app fetches movie data from a backend API, displays it in a user-friendly interface, and provides features like saving movies to a watchlist, viewing movie details, and exploring movies by categories.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

### **Frontend**
- **Flutter**: The app is built using Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building natively compiled applications.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter development.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js**: The backend server is built using Node.js, providing RESTful APIs for fetching and managing movie data.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework used to simplify API development and handle HTTP requests.

### **Database**
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store movie data, user watchlists, and other application data.

### **Features**
- **Backend API**: Custom APIs built with Node.js and Express.js to fetch movie data (e.g., `fetchMovies`, `fetchActionMovies`, etc.) and manage user interactions (e.g., saving/removing movies from the watchlist).
- **State Management**: Uses Flutter's built-in `setState` for managing local state and triggering UI updates.
- **Widgets**: Custom reusable widgets like `MovieComponent`, `ListMovieComponent`, `ImageSlider`, and `CategoriesButton`.
- **Navigation**: Uses Flutter's `Navigator` for seamless screen transitions.
- **Theming**: Custom app theme with dark mode aesthetics.
